Segmenting-and-Clustering-Neighborhoods-in-Toronto_IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-Project_Week-3
There are 3 assignments:
#
(1) For this assignment, you will be required to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto (using BeautifulSoup package)
#
(2) Now that you have built a dataframe of the postal code of each neighborhood along with the borough name and neighborhood name, in order to utilize the Foursquare location data, we need to get the latitude and the longitude coordinates of each neighborhood.
#
(3) Explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. You can decide to work with only boroughs that contain the word Toronto and then replicate the same analysis we did to the New York City data. It is up to you.
